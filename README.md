# Implementation of some basic ML models from scratch
Does use libraries such as numpy, scipy, and pandas though; could write my own python loops but is a lot slower and is beneficial to practice data handling using numpy and pandas so will go that route.

Have implemented the following so far:
- Naive Bayes
    - Bernoulli
    - Mutinomial
    - Gaussian
- KNN
    - Naive implementation
    - Optimized implementation
- Decision tree
    - Classifier
    - Regressor
- Linear models
    - Multiple linear regression
    - Generalized linear models
        - Logistic (Bernoulli)
        - Poisson

To be implemented:
- SVM
- MLP
- Random forest (which is just bagging with decision trees)
- Gradient boosting trees (which is just boosting with decision trees)
